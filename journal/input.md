### Ashley Comment
So Ashley has brought up a good point about the SCR revisions. The revision in question is on pg. 26 of 57.

- Hi Jonathan SCR 129478 PG 26 of 57 Insert A page B there is nothing listed for Column M do you know what that should be?
- My question: Can't it be left blank?
- It is very similar to the requirement 16451, it 
This requirement A-1 is very similar to requirement 8 (a)  from pg 15 of 57. This requirement is an intermediate if statement that cannot be tested. Therefore, I believe all of the attributes should be blank. I had misinterpreted this before. 

### Brian Comment

- I need you to send me the source files for the SRS sections.  Especially if you've modified them based on the comments so I can put a final version together

- Okay can you check these files on the J drive  temp folder. I want to make sure I'm giving you everything. These are the inserts for SEC 3.2.1.11. 
J:\Temporary Files\jlooper\SCR_129480_SEC_3.2.1.11

- If this isn't what you need, please call on teams and I'll get on the same page.

- Okay, so I worked on O&M SRS 3.2.1.11. 
## Notes
- The DOORS Acronyms Attributes for SCR is in NWID_SE_PPG_004 Managing WAAS Requirements. 

## Build Planning
- C&V team waiting for Threat Model data
- Dinh is waiting on the SCR for the GUS Mode Change
- I'm the blocker on this until I get the comments back to Ashley.

## Lessons Learned
- Brian likes the spreadsheets to be modified and then repackaged into pdf. He doesn't like the pdf being edited manually.
