## Most Important Task

- Unit Test Package
	- [x] Check with Ricky on Unit Test Change. Make sure he will make the change.
## Notes
- System build for CY 25
	- Naming decision issue

- I just put together the PDU SCR responses. I was hoping either you or Brian could check them to make sure I'm understanding the comments.. Then I can quickly make the changes to the redlines package.
## Lessons Learned

### Ashley Comment
So Ashley has brought up a good point about the SCR revisions. The revision in question is on pg. 26 of 57.

- Hi Jonathan SCR 129478 PG 26 of 57 Insert A page B there is nothing listed for Column M do you know what that should be?
- My question: Can't it be left blank?
- It is very similar to the requirement 16451, it 
This requirement A-1 is very similar to requirement 8 (a)  from pg 15 of 57. This requirement is an intermediate if statement that cannot be tested. Therefore, I believe all of the attributes should be blank. I had misinterpreted this before. 

### Brian Comment

- I need you to send me the source files for the SRS sections.  Especially if you've modified them based on the comments so I can put a final version together

- Okay can you check these files on the J drive  temp folder. I want to make sure I'm giving you everything. These are the inserts for SEC 3.2.1.11. 
```
J:\Temporary Files\jlooper\SCR_129480_SEC_3.2.1.11
```

- If this isn't what you need, please call on teams and I'll get on the same page.

- Okay, so I worked on O&M SRS 3.2.1.11. 
## Notes
- The DOORS Acronyms Attributes for SCR is in NWID_SE_PPG_004 Managing WAAS Requirements. 

## Build Planning
- C&V team waiting for Threat Model data
- Dinh is waiting on the SCR for the GUS Mode Change
- I'm the blocker on this until I get the comments back to Ashley.

## Lessons Learned
- Brian likes the spreadsheets to be modified and then repackaged into pdf. He doesn't like the pdf being edited manually.

## Most Important Task
- VERY IMPORTANT TO FINISH UNIT TEST BEFORE 10/23
	- Project [DEG_TO_RAD_Unit_Test_Code](../../projects/DEG_TO_RAD_Unit_Test_Code.md)

- Make a list of everything each file that must be updated.
- Make a list of all the unit test packages 
Hi I was bit still confused on the procedure for unit test packages. I might have asked these questions before but I'm just not sure:
- Can a unit test package be submitted with just an e-build? I wasn't sure if I needed to wait for official build.
- I'm updating two RTC unit tests. Can I submit just one package that includes both unit tests?
	- ULBUN1 and 
	- ULIUN1 

## Notes for Build Planning
- Ebuild this week on 10/9 approximately.
- Official Build next week 10/14

## Release Meeting Notes


## Topics
- Friday, Saturday and Sunday
- Mason ACT test.
- Abbey reading speed and comprehension.
- Mixing more geometry and algebra. 
	- I'm thinking this Euclid color book is great at how to combine them.
	- I think fractions get way easier once the geometry is connected to the fraction notation. It's the fraction notation that seems to be a stumbling block for kids. 
	- Also, geometry lends itself to multiplication and division for area calculations.
- I've been working on a backgammon python cli. It's mostly to have a bare minimum simulation that can be hooked in with libs for machine learning.
- CRUD Wastewater Epidemiology
	- Create a CRUD app.
	- I'm mostly wanting to get EPA data organizing it as a hotspot indicators.
	- Use a SCADA HTML5 front end. GLG Toolkit  https://www.genlogic.com/demos.html

## Most Important Task
- VERY IMPORTANT TO FINISH UNIT TEST BEFORE 10/23
	- Project [DEG_TO_RAD_Unit_Test_Code](../../projects/DEG_TO_RAD_Unit_Test_Code.md)
## For PDU Meeting
- For the SCR, I checked the FTP this morning and there haven't been any changes in reviewers:
	- Carl, Bill, NAVTAC, and Robert Bodily.
- I'm continuing to get more familiar with SNMP V3 and how authentication works in it.
	- View
	- User 
	- Group
- Then I'm getting unit test package. Dinh advised me on the procedure.  to Kelsey this week 

- PDU only on POC and get PCAP data from TCP dump.
- MWBE is the CSU for SNMPv3
- 
## Personal Ideas
- Build a small SNMPv3 app that uses BRASS lib in AIX.
- Look at Brian's code on his new build.
- See how to port to Linux and issues.
- Look back at what Ken did in his presentation to learn how it works with WAAS.
- Try to find PNB or NWID that discusses SNMP. Probably going to be WID also in O&M or maybe RTC?
- Then build another small one that uses only LINUX tools.
## Lessons Learned

## Script for PDU Ping

Good morning Bill,

I'm the project engineer assisting Victor with the CY-25 Maintenance Release. Also, I helping with the reviews for the CY-25 SCRs.  SCR 129480 for the PCU to PDU conversion is currently going through final peer review. The package is on cqftp at:

- ftp:SITE

I attached the latest SCR final version for your review.

- FILENAME.pdf

Also, NAVTAC has reviewed and we have responses for their review in the following spreadsheet:
- FILENAME.xlsx

The original files can also be downloaded from the cqftp at:

Please let me know if I can help in any way. 

Thank you,

## Release Meeting Notes
id 
18 - Latest Date for ADD Updates - Rhiannon said no change.
54 - Validate ADD - Rhiannon said no change.
139 - Peer review - 90% - We have two remaining SCRs for Fix False Doppler and Update PIDS
177 - Redline ICDs - No change

TODO: Check on ICDs percentage

# 2024-10-17

## Next Task
- [x] Look at all of Dinh's and Chris Varner's unit test PCRs

Unit Test Ideas
- Somehow determine if the unit test needs to be converted.
- Create the unit test yourself in Parasoft C++.
- Possibly copy over an existing unit test template.
- 

Kelsey, I'm making a tiny update to RTC unit test ULIUN1 for PCR 129825. ULIUN1 hasn't been converted to Parasoft C++. ULBUN1 has already been converted to Parasoft C++.

Would you be okay with me leaving it in the old format or should I plan on converting it over to Parasoft C++? I wasn't sure though.

This is the info about the PCR
```
PCR 129825 Descripition:
The constant LXUN_RAD_TO_DEG will be renamed to LXUN_DEG_TO_RAD in the following files:  
  
rtc/ULBUN1/parasoft.suppress  
rtc/ULBUN1/tests/ULBUN1001.c  
rtc/ULIUN1/ulxun1_tcase_1.c  
  
These updates match the change made to LxUN_uen_matrix.c (PCR 129538).
```

Hi Dinh, sorry for all these questions about unit tests. I'm making a tiny update to RTC unit test ULIUN1 for PCR 129825. ULIUN1 hasn't been converted yet. Do you usually convert all unit tests when you find an old style one? I wasn't sure if it might be part of Raytheon's work though.

I checked and ULIUN1 is an RTC unit test that hasn't been converted. Have you ever converted a unit test over or has Raytheon done all of these conversions before? 
## Questions
- Brian having issues with Var files for Simple Agent Pro?

- [x] Get Parasoft C++ working again with DTP.
	- Try using the /opt version 
		- RESULT: No Change
	- Try logging into DTP:
		- RESULT: This was the issue. I needed to use jlooper jlooper
- Issue: I'm not able to get the unit test to execute. I keep getting the following error:
```

```
I think this could be due to the .profile.jlooper being corrupteed.
- [x] Try using .profile.bgraefe and updating
	- RESULT: No change. It wasn't the .profile.jlooper
- [x] Possible Cause: The project for ULBUN1 may be incorrect
	- Try running a unit test for another project like UIMVM4
	- RESULT: UIMVM4 builds correctly. Therefore, there is an issue with ULBUN1
- [ ] Possible Cause: Maybe it is the build. 
	- Currently, it is using

- Test using `WE65.005C
	- RESULT: No change. It is not the build 

- Possible Cause: Maybe the project files have been corrupted. 
	- Try copying the ULBUN1 from clearcase again.
	- RESULT: No change
- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SOLVED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- Possible Cause: The unit under test file `LxUN_uen_matrix.c` must be in the `ULBUN1` directory.

	- 
## Release Meeting Notes

139 - Peer review - 90% - We have two remaining SCRs:
for Fix False Doppler and Update PIDS.
WAIT until asked - 

177 - Redline ICDs - 40%
178 - Redline ICD Addendum -40%

WAIT until asked - 222 - CSU Tests - 60%

### Note to Kelsey
Hi Kelsey, I ran all the unit tests for my change to LxUN_uen_matrix.c.  
The unit test packages impacted are ULBUN1 and ULIUN1. 
Do I need to create 2 separate initial packages for ULBUN1 and ULIUN1? 
Or could I just create it for ULxUN1?

The initial package for ULBUN1 is in the following directory on the J Drive:

```
J:\AJW-1526\Projects\Active\WAAS-2023-000004-A CY24-25 Maintenance Release\Unit_Test\ULxUN1\
ULBUN1_initial.pdf
```

Also, I'm preparing for the CY25 Release meeting at 3:00
Do you know about the % complete on  DCP ICD and addendum? I wasn't sure
We only have IDs 177 and 178 for the ICD updates. We didn't break it out by CSCI.

## Brian's notes
PCCP 
- OSP ADD data 
- 2 sets of entry for firewall or not
- Change to site type between GUS A and GUS B
- Site Type with GUS without firewall

With a firewall we cycle that piece of equipment. Turn off outlet 3 if there is a firewall. 

When LOC goes away, the firewall will go away.

Eric needs the PDU config for that receptacle turned off.
